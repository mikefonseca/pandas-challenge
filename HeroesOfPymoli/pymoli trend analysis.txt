Three observable trends based on the data:

- 81% of players are male and spend almost 5% more than their female counterparts, meaning marketing budget should focus on these core consumers, given their organic attraction to the game, to drive new sales.

- 76% of buyers are in the 15-29 category.  While their average spend is slightly lower than the 30-34 and 40+ category, given the sheer numbers of people attracted to the game in this segment, marketing spend should be focused on attracting these gamers given their strong interaction and the social networking effect of word-of-mouth at these numbers, and figuring out how to acquire more wallet share from their interests.


- Given retribution axe is both in the top 5 of purchases (with 9) and also the most profitable item available, we want to consider, and certain other very profitable items are very close to being purchased in the higher rates (of 9+), we want to consider the cross-section of the power users who buy them, so that we can offer bundling to incentivize more buying, raise prices on the most popular items given increased demand to make them more profitable, and give them specific incentives so that they proselytize the game's value more widely and attract other customers to reach their level (similar to Hearthstone).
